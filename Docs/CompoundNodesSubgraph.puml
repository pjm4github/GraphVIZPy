title Compound Node and Subgraph Relationship

' Classes for Node and Subgraph:

class Node {
    + compound_node_data : CompoundNodeData
}

class CompoundNodeData {
    + subgraph : Subgraph
}

class Subgraph {
    + cmp_graph_data : SubgraphData
    ' possibly also has .nodes dict referencing Node
}

class SubgraphData {
    + node : Node
}

' Show the links:
Node --> CompoundNodeData : owns
CompoundNodeData --> Subgraph : subgraph
Subgraph --> SubgraphData : has
SubgraphData --> Node : references
